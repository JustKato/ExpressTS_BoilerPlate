<h1>About</h1>
<p>Hey there, this is the main body of the content, over here you can see that this file is individual from the other
    ones</p>
<p>It is completely isolated and has nothing to do with the header or the footer</p>
<br>
<h1>Examples</h1>
<p>Wanna know what date it is? It's --> {{{time}}}</p>
<br>
<h1>Example Listing</h1>
<p>
    This is just some filler text ðŸ˜Š
</p>
<p>
    Sorry about the lack of style, but I really wanted to keep this as vanilla and minimal as possible
    whilst still providing a solid example for as many
    things as possible.<br>
    It is quite a bit more complex than the <code>master</code> branch, but it's still super useful!
</p>
<p>
    Here's an example of how to use for-loops, if you are new I think this will come in handy, I know that
    it was quite a bother for me to find a working example, the following works amazingly well with this
    project setup.

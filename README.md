## Description
A boilerplate for `ExpressJS` using `TypeScript` and `HandleBars` as a templating engine, this is most useful
for people that wish to create a website that is server-side rendered using nodejs, in my opinion that's a great idea
it's super manageable when you have a nice project layout ( such as this one ).
